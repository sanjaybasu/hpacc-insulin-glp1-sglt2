# Reduced Insulin Use and Disability Upon Introduction of SGLT-2 Inhibitors and GLP1-Receptor Agonists in Low and Middle-Income Countries: A Microsimulation
Global Health & Population Project on Access to Care for Cardiometabolic Diseases (HPACC)

Summary

Background
Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes, is a growing health concern in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The high rate of hypoglycemia associated with insulin use in these settings contributes to significant health complications and disabilities. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have shown promise in reducing insulin dosage and improving health outcomes, but their potential impact in LMICs remains unclear.

Methods
We used a microsimulation model to estimate the potential impact of treating patients with diabetes who are using insulin with GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT-2 inhibitors in LMICs. The model utilized data from the Global Health and Population Project on Access to Care for Cardiometabolic Diseases (HPACC) dataset, which included nationally representative surveys from 79 countries. The primary outcome was the change in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost per 1000 person-years due to severe hypoglycemia, cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, weight change, and all-cause mortality.

Findings
The addition of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors resulted in median reductions in insulin dosage of 8.2 IU/day (IQR: 6.9, 9.5) and 5.3 IU/day (IQR: 4.5, 6.2), respectively. The median DALYs lost per 1000 person-years decreased from 7.00 (IQR: 5.31, 11.50) to 5.80 (IQR: 4.50, 11.80) with GLP-1 receptor agonists and 6.17 (IQR: 4.75, 12.58) with SGLT-2 inhibitors. The reduction in severe hypoglycemia was the primary driver of DALY improvements, accounting for 66% and 57% of the total improvement in GLP-1 receptor agonist and SGLT-2 inhibitor scenarios, respectively.

Interpretation
The introduction of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors for managing type 2 diabetes in LMICs could significantly reduce insulin dosage and the associated risk of severe hypoglycemia, leading to improved health outcomes and reduced disability. These findings support the case for increasing access to these therapies in LMICs.
