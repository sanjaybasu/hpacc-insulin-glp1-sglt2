# Reduced Insulin Use and Disability Upon Introduction of SGLT-2 Inhibitors and GLP1-Receptor Agonists in Low and Middle-Income Countries: A Microsimulation
Global Health & Population Project on Access to Care for Cardiometabolic Diseases (HPACC)

Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes, is a growing health concern in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We sought to estimate the degree to which glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors may reduce insulin dosage and improve health outcomes in LMICs.
